The words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions. These definitions shall have the same meaning regardless of whether they appear in singular or plural.

## 1. Data Collection

We collect various types of personal and usage data to provide and improve our app's functionality. The types of data we collect include:

### Personal Information
- We collect your **name** and **email address** for account creation, login, and account management purposes. This data is essential for the app to function as intended and is required for creating and managing your user account.

### Financial Information
- We collect and securely store your **payment information** to process transactions within the app. We do not store full credit card details on our servers; instead, payment data is securely processed by third-party payment processors.

### In-App Messages
- We collect in-app messages, such as emails and other communications, for customer support and to improve app functionality.

### Photos, Videos, Audio, and Files
- We may collect **photos**, **videos**, **voice or sound recordings**, and other files as part of the app’s features (e.g., user profile, messaging). Users can choose whether to upload such data.

## 2. Data Security

We take your data security seriously. All user data collected is encrypted in transit using secure protocols to prevent unauthorized access. This includes personal, financial, and any other sensitive information shared via the app.

- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted using secure protocols (SSL/TLS) to protect your personal information when transmitted over the internet.
- **Third-Party Services**: Payment information is securely processed by third-party services, and we do not store your full credit card data.

## 3. Account Creation and Authentication

To create an account, users must provide a **username** and **password**. Additionally, authentication may involve **two-factor authentication (2FA)**, **one-time password (OTP)**, or **biometric verification**, depending on the user’s device and settings.

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

We retain your data as long as it is necessary to provide the app’s services and comply with legal obligations. You have the right to request the deletion of your personal data; however, note that some data may remain for legal or accounting purposes. Currently, we do not provide a separate option for data deletion without account deletion.

## 5. User Rights

You have the right to:
- Access, correct, or delete the personal information we collect.
- Update your account settings or contact our support team for assistance.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of significant changes by updating the effective date at the top of this page. Please review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of **13**. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.
